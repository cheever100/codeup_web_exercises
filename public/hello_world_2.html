		<h1>
			Hello Class!
		</h1>

		<p>My name is Jean Cheever. I'm <strong>sorry</strong> I did not get to meet everyone the first morning of class. I was born and raised in <span style="color:red">San Antonio</span> but spent about 20 years working on the <span style="color:blue">East Coast</span> primarily in the Pharma industry. I have been producing theatre for the past 13 years in <span style="color:blue">New York City</span>. <br>Although I split my time 50/50 between <span style="color:red">San Antonio</span> and <span style="color:blue">New York City</span>, lately I've been in <span style="color:red">San Antonio</span> more. I have gotten involved in the biotech world and am currently a board member for StemBioSys, a stem cell startup commercializing technology from the UTHSC. I am also on the board of a <em>local</em> bank and an active member of the Mayor's Fitness Council. So I may have to miss some class to keep up with these organizations but I promise to keep up.</p>

		<h2>
			My Vehicle
		</h2>
			<p>
				I finally bought a new car after 14 years. I actually bought it off the Internet which is freaking out most of my friends and family. A friend helped me find a reasonable priced 2012 BMW 4-door sedan Series 7. It was shipped from CA. I honestly love it although it's a bit hard to get used to because it is much larger than my previous car (a BMW 320ci 2-door convertible).
